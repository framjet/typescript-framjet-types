# FramJet Types

The `@framjet/types` package is an essential TypeScript utility designed specifically for seamless conversions between
string representations and TypeScript types. This library excels in transforming string literals into corresponding
TypeScript types and vice versa, which is crucial for dynamic type assertions and validations in TypeScript
applications. It includes a variety of type utilities covering functions, collections, JSON structures, and primitives,
each tailored to facilitate precise type transformations. The package is invaluable for developers who need to handle
type metadata dynamically, providing robust support for interpreting and constructing type information at runtime,
thereby enhancing the flexibility and robustness of TypeScript projects.
